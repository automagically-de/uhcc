My offer for "The Underhanded C Contest" 2006[1]:
===============================================================================

This programs performs very badly on Solaris/Sparc while running fast on
Linux/i386 (sadly it is somewhat hardware-dependent...).

To compile, just run "make", which produces an executable file called
"uhcc_sort". The default compiler is gcc on both platforms, feel free to
use the commercial compiler (Forte Developer C) on Slowlaris.

The testing (see OS-Tests.txt) was done with the following command line:

$ time ./uhcc_sort < test.txt

Other input files are usable, too - of course.

Happy Bug-Hunting!
